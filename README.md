# Lyrics.java
A very simple lyrics client based on YouTube and [Lyrics.Kt](https://github.com/DRSchlaubi/lyrics.kt)

## Differences from Lyrics.kt
The biggest difference between this version and the kotlin version is the filesize.
At the time of writing, lyrics.kt plugin is about `7 MB` in size, while this plugin is about `26 KB` in size. A massive reduction.

The second difference is the search endpoint. 
Instead of putting the query into the path of the url, this plugin opted to use query parameters for it.
Making the endpoint more restfull.
